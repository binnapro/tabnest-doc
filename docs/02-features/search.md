# Global Search - Find Any Tab Instantly

TabNest's powerful global search feature lets you find any saved tab across all your Spaces and Tab Groups in seconds.

## Opening the Search

### Keyboard Shortcut

Press **Cmd+F** (Mac) or **Ctrl+F** (Windows/Linux) to open the search dialog.

### Using the Search Button

1. Open TabNest dashboard
2. Click the **🔍 Search** button in the top toolbar
3. Start typing to search

## How to Search

Simply type keywords and TabNest will search:
- **Tab titles** - The name of the website or page
- **URLs** - The web address
- **Both** - Matching against either title or URL

## Search Tips

### Basic Search

Type a simple keyword:
- `react` - Find all tabs related to React
- `api` - Find API documentation
- `github` - Find GitHub links

### Advanced Search

You can combine multiple keywords:
- `react tutorial` - Find tabs containing both "react" and "tutorial"
- Use spaces to add more conditions

### Search Results

Results appear instantly as you type:
- Click any result to open the tab
- See which Space and Group the tab is in
- Multiple matches are ranked by relevance

## Search Filters (Advanced)

In Settings, you can configure:
- **Search scope** - Search all Spaces or current Space only
- **Case sensitivity** - Match exact capitalization
- **URL only** - Search only URLs, not titles

## Tips & Tricks

### Finding Duplicates

If you have duplicate tabs:
1. Search for a unique part of the URL
2. Check if multiple results appear
3. Delete duplicates to clean up

### Quick Navigation

Use search as a quick way to navigate:
- Don't remember which Space something is in?
- Search for it instead of manually browsing
- Click the result to jump there

### Organizing by Search

After searching, you can:
- Bulk select search results
- Move them to a different Group
- Delete them all at once

## Limitations

- Search is case-insensitive by default
- Searches the last 100 characters of URL
- Can't search by metadata (date, color, etc.)

4. (Optional) Choose a color and icon
5. Click **"Create"**

### Method 2: From Saved Tabs

1. Save multiple tabs to a Space
2. Right-click a saved tab
3. Select **"Move to New Group"**

## Understanding Group Features

### Color Coding

Each group can have a color for visual organization:
- **Blue** - API References, Documentation
- **Green** - Active Projects, In Progress
- **Yellow** - To Review, Important
- **Red** - High Priority, Urgent
- **Purple** - Learning, Research
- **Gray** - Archived, On Hold

Click the color dot next to a group name to change it.

### Icons

Similar to Spaces, groups can have emoji icons:
- 📚 Documentation
- 🎨 Design Resources
- 🔧 Tools
- 📊 Analytics
- 🛠️ Development
- 📝 Notes

Click the icon to open the emoji picker.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Naming Groups

- **Be specific**: "React Components" is better than "Stuff"
- **Use verbs when appropriate**: "To Review", "In Progress", "Completed"
- **Keep it short**: Aim for 2-4 words
- **Use prefixes for ordering**: "1. Research", "2. Design", "3. Development"

### Organization Patterns

**By Task Stage:**
- "🔍 Research"
- "📝 Planning"
- "🔨 Implementation"
- "✅ Testing"
- "📦 Deployment"

**By Document Type:**
- "📚 Documentation"
- "🎨 Design Files"
- "📊 Data & Analytics"
- "📋 Requirements"

**By Urgency:**
- "🔴 Critical"
- "🟠 High Priority"
- "🟡 Medium Priority"
- "🟢 Low Priority"

### Managing Group Overflow

If a Space has many groups:
1. **Use Collapse** - Collapse inactive groups
2. **Archive Strategy** - Move old groups to an "Archive" Space
3. **Regular Review** - Delete empty or unused groups monthly
4. **Sub-spaces** - If too complex, consider creating a new Space instead

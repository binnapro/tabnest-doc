# Spaces - Organize Your Work

Spaces are the foundation of TabNest's organization system. Think of them as independent workspaces, each with its own set of tab groups and saved tabs.

## What is a Space?

A **Space** is a container that helps you organize tabs by project, context, or any categorization that makes sense to you. For example:
- Work projects (Frontend, Backend, Design)
- Personal interests (Learning, Shopping, Entertainment)
- Time-based contexts (Q4 2024 Goals, Research Project A)

## Creating a Space

### Method 1: From Dashboard

1. Open TabNest and look at the **left sidebar**
2. Click the **"+"** button at the top of the Space list
3. Enter a name for your Space
4. (Optional) Select an emoji icon for quick visual recognition
5. Click **"Create"**

### Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut

You can also use the keyboard shortcut to quickly open the creation dialog (settings configurable).

## Customizing Spaces

### Rename a Space

1. Right-click on a Space name
2. Select **"Rename"**
3. Enter the new name
4. Press Enter or click away

### Change the Icon

1. Click on a Space name to select it
2. Look for the icon in the Space header
3. Click to open the emoji picker
4. Select your preferred emoji

### Delete a Space

⚠️ **Warning**: This action cannot be undone!

1. Right-click on a Space
2. Select **"Delete"**
3. Confirm the deletion

Note: All tab groups and tabs in the Space will be deleted.

## Switching Between Spaces

Click any Space name in the left sidebar to switch to it. The main area will update to show that Space's tab groups and tabs.

### Last Active Space

TabNest remembers which Space you were viewing last. When you reopen the extension, it will automatically show that Space.

## Reordering Spaces

Drag and drop Spaces in the left sidebar to reorganize them in your preferred order.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., "Frontend Dev" instead of "Project 1")
- Consider using prefixes for quick scanning (e.g., "📚 Learning", "💼 Work")
- Keep names concise (15-20 characters ideal)

### Organization Strategies

**By Project:**
- One Space per project
- Great for developers and designers
- Example: "E-commerce Site", "Mobile App", "Documentation"

**By Context:**
- Organize by time (Current Sprint, Next Quarter)
- Or by activity (Research, Planning, Execution)
- Useful for project managers

**By Domain:**
- One Space per work domain
- Example: "Marketing", "Engineering", "Operations"
- Works well for larger teams

## Merging Spaces

If you have two Spaces you'd like to combine:

1. Open the Space you want to merge from
2. Select all tab groups (use Ctrl+A or manually select)
3. Cut the groups (Ctrl+X)
4. Switch to the destination Space
5. Paste (Ctrl+V)

Or use the **Merge Spaces** feature (if available in Settings):
1. Go to Settings → Data Management
2. Look for "Merge Spaces" option
3. Follow the dialog to combine Spaces

## Converting Tab Groups to Spaces

If you have a very organized tab group that deserves its own Space:

1. Select the tab group
2. Right-click and select **"Convert to Space"**
3. A new Space will be created with the group's contents
4. The original tab group will be removed

## Storage & Sync

Each Space's data is stored locally in your browser. You can sync Spaces to the cloud:
- See [Cloud Sync](./cloud-sync) for GitHub Gist or WebDAV setup
- All Spaces are included in cloud backups

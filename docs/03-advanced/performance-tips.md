# Performance Optimization Tips

Keep TabNest running smoothly with these optimization strategies.

## Managing Large Collections

### Archive Old Spaces

- Move completed projects to "Archive" Space
- Keeps active view cleaner and faster
- Archive Space can be hidden from main view

### Delete Duplicates

- Use search to find duplicate tabs
- Bulk delete to free up space
- Run search for duplicate URLs

### Compress Groups

- Collapse inactive groups
- Delete unused groups regularly
- Keep active groups under 50 tabs each

## Browser Performance

### Clear Cache

1. Open TabNest → Settings
2. Go to Data Management
3. Click "Clear Cache"
4. Restart browser

### Disable Auto-Sync (If Needed)

- If sync is slowing things down:
1. Settings → Cloud Sync
2. Disable auto-sync
3. Manually sync when needed

### Reduce AI Requests

- Don't categorize massive tab collections
- Batch categorize 10-20 tabs at a time
- Wait between categorization sessions

## System Resources

### Memory Usage

- TabNest typically uses less than 50MB RAM
- Close unused Spaces to reduce memory
- Restart browser weekly if memory high

### CPU Usage

- Heavy searching can spike CPU temporarily
- Sort operations are optimized
- Wait for current operation to complete

## Browser Storage

### Check Available Space

- Settings → Storage Usage
- Browser storage typically 50-100MB
- Export and delete if running low

### Multiple Browsers

- TabNest uses browser-specific storage
- Each browser has separate copy
- Sync between browsers with cloud sync

## Best Practices

1. **Regular maintenance** - Delete unused items monthly
2. **Use search** - Don't browse manually through huge lists
3. **Archive projects** - Move old work to separate Space
4. **Batch operations** - Do multiple actions together
5. **Monitor storage** - Check usage regularly
